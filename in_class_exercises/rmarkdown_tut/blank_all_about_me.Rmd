## Bio {#bachelors-degree}
My name is Laeticia! I am a 4th year at UofT as of writing this. My programs are Bioinformatics and Computational Biology specialist, Molecular Genetics and Microbiology major, and Computer Science minor. I like nerdy stuff. Specifically, the weeb-y side of nerd. Concerning more serious topics, I've always been a life sciences person since I was a kid. Right now, the fields I find most interesting are dev. bio, evol. bio and mol. gen!

## Bachelors Degree 
### All the courses I've taken{#bachelors-degree-table}
**Table 1. Record of all undergraduate courses** 
``` {r courses_table, include=TRUE,echo=TRUE}
# generate table with knitr::kable()
colnames(courses) <- c("Course Dept", "Course Code", "Year", "Type")
paged_table(courses, options=list(rows.print=5))
```

### Courses by year and department {#bachelors-degree-figure}
The following figures show the distribution of the courses I've taken, according to year, and department.
``` {r courses_figure, include=TRUE, echo=TRUE, fig.cap = "**Figure 1: Courses by Year** Courses according to the year and department."}
## organize the data for plotting
# idk what to do here

# generate plot 
ggplot2::ggplot(data=courses,
                mapping=aes(x=`Course Dept`,
                            fill=as.factor(`Year`))) +
  ggplot2::geom_bar(position="stack",
                    show.legend=T) +
  ggplot2::labs(title="Courses by Dept",
                x="Dept",
                y="Number of courses",
