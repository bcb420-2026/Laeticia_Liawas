Recent studies additionally imply an involvement of the wildtype protein in tumor progression, but the underlaying mechanism remains elusive. Here we report that SF3B1 acts as a coactivator for hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) 1α. SF3B1 directly interacts with HIF1a, augments HIF1a-HIF1b heterodimer binding to hypoxia response elements in vivo and enhances transactivation of HIF target genes. In human patients, primary patient cells and in a mouse model of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), efficient HIF1a-signalling relies on SF3B1. Monoallelic deletion of Sf3b1 in this mouse tumor model severely delays tumor initiation and development and diminishes HIF target gene transcription, glucose uptake and proliferation in corresponding tumor organoids in hypoxia, while splicing remains functional. Here, we define a subset of aggressive chromophobe renal cell carcinomas (chRCCs) able to transcriptionally compensate monoallelic SF3B1 loss, a feature that correlates with poor prognosis and lymph node spread and we show that the oncogenic hotspot mutation SF3B1K700E has reduced co-activation efficiency. Also, we report increased sensitivity of cells with low levels of SF3B1 to the HIF-inhibitor PX-478. These findings reveal a splicing-independent, tumor promoting function of SF3B1, important in the pathogenesis of PDAC and other cancers.&quot; From the title, summary and platform organism, we can infer that the study uses primary patient-derived cancer cells. 7.3 Q3 From the query below, we can see that there are 8 samples. # Get samples (GSM) sql &lt;- paste0(&quot;SELECT * &quot;, &quot;FROM gse JOIN gse_gsm ON gse_gsm.gse = gse.gse &quot;, &quot;JOIN gsm ON gse_gsm.gsm = gsm.gsm &quot;, &quot;WHERE gse.gse = &#39;&quot;, gse1_num, &quot;&#39;&quot;) gse1 &lt;- dbGetQuery(con, sql) dim(gse1) ## [1] 8 52 For each sample, the following information is associated with its record. dbListFields(con, &quot;gsm&quot;) ## [1] &quot;ID&quot; &quot;title&quot; &quot;gsm&quot; ## [4] &quot;series_id&quot; &quot;gpl&quot; &quot;status&quot; ## [7] &quot;submission_date&quot; &quot;last_update_date&quot; &quot;type&quot; ## [10] &quot;source_name_ch1&quot; &quot;organism_ch1&quot; &quot;characteristics_ch1&quot; ## [13] &quot;molecule_ch1&quot; &quot;label_ch1&quot; &quot;treatment_protocol_ch1&quot; ## [16] &quot;extract_protocol_ch1&quot; &quot;label_protocol_ch1&quot; &quot;source_name_ch2&quot; ## [19] &quot;organism_ch2&quot; &quot;characteristics_ch2&quot; &quot;molecule_ch2&quot; ## [22] &quot;label_ch2&quot; &quot;treatment_protocol_ch2&quot; &quot;extract_protocol_ch2&quot; ## [25] &quot;label_protocol_ch2&quot; &quot;hyb_protocol&quot; &quot;description&quot; ## [28] &quot;data_processing&quot; &quot;contact&quot; &quot;supplementary_file&quot; ## [31] &quot;data_row_count&quot; &quot;channel_count&quot; 7.4 Q4 # Controls # Choosing LIKE keyword by looking through a few of the sample titles: sql &lt;- paste0(&quot;SELECT COUNT(*)&quot;, &quot;FROM gse JOIN gse_gsm ON gse_gsm.gse = gse.gse &quot;, &quot;JOIN gsm ON gse_gsm.gsm = gsm.gsm &quot;, &quot;WHERE gse.gse = &#39;&quot;, gse1_num, &quot;&#39;&quot;, &quot;AND gsm.title LIKE &#39;%ctrl%&#39;&quot;) dbGetQuery(con, sql) ## COUNT(*) ## 1 5 There are 5 control samples.

Since then the economical, health and human cost has been enormous for the world. However, little work has been done to understand the transcriptional changes brought about by the virus in human hosts. We have compared COVID-19 positive samples with negative samples from Indian patients to better understand the host response.. We find many genes related to immune response up-regulated in the COVID-19 patients. Many of these are the usual response genes against the viral infection but type I interferon appears to be a key immune response activated against SARS-CoV-2. A large number of the differentially expressed genes were down-regulated pointing towards translational arrest and down regulation of host mRNA during late infection. The down-regulated genes are well correlated with the clinical manifestations and symptoms due to SARS-CoV-2 infection such as the loss of smell and taste. We also find evidence of altered gene expression profiles associated with systemic complications such as neurological disturbances and high insulin requirement. Finally, we have identified many lncRNAs being down-regulated during COVID-19 infections. A few of these lncRNAs have functional role in viral infection. However, to understand the functional role of other lncRNAs, we looked at the function of their closest gene, since lncRNA are believed to have cis functionality.

Here we describe a human methylome atlas, based on deep whole-genome bisulfite sequencing of 39 cell types sorted from 205 healthy tissue samples. Replicates of the same cell type are &gt;99.5% identical, demonstrating robustness of cell identity programs to genetic variation and environmental perturbation. Unsupervised clustering of the atlas recapitulates key elements of tissue ontogeny, and identifies methylation patterns retained since gastrulation. Loci uniquely unmethylated in an individual cell type often reside in transcriptional enhancers and contain DNA binding sites for tissue-specific transcriptional regulators. Uniquely methylated loci are rare and are enriched for CpG islands, polycomb targets, and CTCF binding sites, suggesting a role in shaping cell type-specific chromatin looping. The atlas provides an essential resource for interpretation of disease-associated genetic variants, and a wealth of potential tissue-specific biomarkers for use in liquid biopsies.&quot; From the title, summary and platform organism, we can infer that the study uses many different cell types as a model, and there doesn’t seem to be any ‘disease’ being interrogated here. 10.3 Q3 From the query below, we can see that there are 253 samples. # Get samples (GSM) sql &lt;- paste0(&quot;SELECT * &quot;, &quot;FROM gse JOIN gse_gsm ON gse_gsm.gse = gse.gse &quot;, &quot;JOIN gsm ON gse_gsm.gsm = gsm.gsm &quot;, &quot;WHERE gse.gse = &#39;&quot;, gse4_num, &quot;&#39;&quot;) gse4 &lt;- dbGetQuery(con, sql) dim(gse4) ## [1] 253 52 For each sample, the following information is associated with its record. dbListFields(con, &quot;gsm&quot;) ## [1] &quot;ID&quot; &quot;title&quot; &quot;gsm&quot; ## [4] &quot;series_id&quot; &quot;gpl&quot; &quot;status&quot; ## [7] &quot;submission_date&quot; &quot;last_update_date&quot; &quot;type&quot; ## [10] &quot;source_name_ch1&quot; &quot;organism_ch1&quot; &quot;characteristics_ch1&quot; ## [13] &quot;molecule_ch1&quot; &quot;label_ch1&quot; &quot;treatment_protocol_ch1&quot; ## [16] &quot;extract_protocol_ch1&quot; &quot;label_protocol_ch1&quot; &quot;source_name_ch2&quot; ## [19] &quot;organism_ch2&quot; &quot;characteristics_ch2&quot; &quot;molecule_ch2&quot; ## [22] &quot;label_ch2&quot; &quot;treatment_protocol_ch2&quot; &quot;extract_protocol_ch2&quot; ## [25] &quot;label_protocol_ch2&quot; &quot;hyb_protocol&quot; &quot;description&quot; ## [28] &quot;data_processing&quot; &quot;contact&quot; &quot;supplementary_file&quot; ## [31] &quot;data_row_count&quot; &quot;channel_count&quot; 10.4 Q4 Because of the nature of this study, there are no ‘controls’ or ‘disease’ samples.
