# Exercises: Inspect GSE162183

Will be done based on 06_1.

## Q1

The following query did not seem to yield any rows.
```{r}
gse3_num <- "GSE162183"

sql <- paste(
  "SELECT DISTINCT gpl.technology",
  "FROM gse JOIN gse_gpl ON gse_gpl.gse = gse.gse",
  "JOIN gpl ON gse_gpl.gpl = gpl.gpl",
  "WHERE gse_gpl.gse ='", gse3_num, "'")

dbGetQuery(con, sql)
```

However, this shows that there is a GPL accession associated to this GSE, but it is not in the 'gpl' table.
```{r}
sql <- paste0(
  "SELECT * ",
  "FROM gse_gpl ",
  "WHERE gse_gpl.gse ='", gse3_num, "'")
dbGetQuery(con, sql)
dbGetQuery(con, "select count(*) from gpl where gpl = 'GPL24676'")
```
From the [GEO website](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi), using the GPL Accession GPL24676 as retrieved from the query above, the platform technology of this GSE seems to be **'high-throughput sequencing'**, titled "Illumina NovaSeq 6000 (Homo sapiens)".

## Q2

```{r}
sql <- paste0(
  "SELECT title, summary ",
  "FROM gse ",
  "WHERE gse = '", gse3_num, "'")
gse3 <- dbGetQuery(con, sql)
gse3$title
gse3$summary
```
From the title, summary and platform organism, we can infer that the study is based on human psoriasis, from full thickness skin from the lesion region.

## Q3 

From the query below, we can see that there are 6 samples.
```{r}
# Get samples (GSM)
sql <- paste0("SELECT * ",
              "FROM gse JOIN gse_gsm ON gse_gsm.gse = gse.gse ",
              "JOIN gsm ON gse_gsm.gsm = gsm.gsm ",
              "WHERE gse.gse = '", gse3_num, "'")
gse3 <- dbGetQuery(con, sql)
dim(gse3)
```

For each sample, the following information is associated with its record.
```{r}
dbListFields(con, "gsm")
```

## Q4

```{r}
# Controls
# Choosing LIKE keyword by looking through a few of the sample titles:
sql <- paste0("SELECT COUNT(*)",
              "FROM gse JOIN gse_gsm ON gse_gsm.gse = gse.gse ",
              "JOIN gsm ON gse_gsm.gsm = gsm.gsm ",
              "WHERE gse.gse = '", gse3_num, "'",
              "AND gsm.title LIKE '%control%'")
dbGetQuery(con, sql)
```
There are 3 control samples. Thus we can infer that there are 3 disease samples. This is also mentioned in the GSE summary.
